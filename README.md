Visualising the COVID-19 data and to analyse it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic and to be able to take data-driven and informed response decisions. The use of the dashboard can extend to a broad range of audiences including researchers, health officials, scientists and general public. The dashboard will be a demonstration for all the important COVID-19 statistics to help them draw inferences from the data. It will also assist as the status update of the pandemic across the world.
